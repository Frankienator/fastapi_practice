# fastapi_practice

In this repository, I am learning the basics of FastAPI as a stepping stone to Backend and ultimately fullstack development with Python.

Going through the Tutorial as given here https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/, I am trying to get a feel on how Python Applications work in the background.

This should help with fast prototyping, similar to Flask, a preliminary or warmup to a more advanced python Framework such as Django, and even to develop some small microservices to later self-host using Docker Containers
